This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `FixedArray.java` file provides a corrected version with the appropriate loop condition.
